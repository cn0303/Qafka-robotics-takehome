# By : Chandran Nandkumar

## Task Overview
2 Data Structures and Algorithms problems involving graphs, binary search and arrays. The problems have been solved on Python and accept only the necessary inputs and show the answers correct to the desired precision.

## Execution
- Git clone the repository to the necessary folder
- Run the code with python3 <name-of-problem>.py
- Enter the necessary values you would like to test it on.
- The files also accept file based input, so you can choose to import the values from a file using the < operator. E.g. python3 <name-of-problem>.py < test.txt

## Answers to reflection questions
The answers to the explanation, train-of-thought and discussion on the time complexity are provided in planet.py and pizzeria.py. The Github gist for the same is shared as well.
